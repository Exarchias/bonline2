# About Bonline

<!--`this is a paragraph` -->

`The idea is to create a web page where people can buy clothing and accessories online. Online, you can currently find many different clothing brands and options for virtually anything that’s able to be transported through a courier system. However, there are some developing countries that haven’t adapted to the current era of online shopping. Our project plan is to target these developing areas, as there is an untapped market for online shopping that can be made comprehensible and reliable. One of the project group members is from a country that can benefit from such a marketplace. Their family owns a clothing business and could highly benefit from a cloth shopping website such as our project. This project is not only intended for the completion of this course, but to be developed into commercial use in the future. `

# Why bonline?
`One of the reasons we are excited to continue to develop this project is because we believe in its ability to create a functional webpage that imitates those within the successful clothing markets. Although it may not reach its fullest potential within the projects time frame due to time limitations, we believe this project could be a gateway to a successful clothing webpage using the skills we learned in both of the web and cloud development courses.`

# Goals
`Our goal is to create a fully functional clothing and accessory webapage where are User has the ability to purchase items with reliability and security. As with every project we have certain goals we would like to accomplish but may scrap in the future. `

# Techinical aspects
`The page uses the Heroku cloud platform to stay online at all times and it is an integration between a github repository and a the Heroku platform. Also the page is builded upon Node.js and the module Express.js which is the one that gives to the page its HTTP protocol handling functionalities.
The page was builded from scratch and no frameworks lime jquery or angular.js were used and it was an exploration of the capabilities of node.js and a comparison about what approach can lead to a better user experience.`

## Not delivered features
`A few of the features were not delivered because of the lack of time. No encryption was added mostly because of the lack of time, and we also failed to deliver a system of uploading pictures that we tried to deliver because of difficulties with the technology and the lack of time.`

## New features
`Through the implementation of the page we had the pleasure to test and to integrate new technologies. At first we managed to deliver a dynamic item or user display page generation that enriches and gives a better character to the page. Another thing that we implemented but we unfortunatelly delivered only for the contact page is the direct connection of the server with a github account that delivers emails to the several stakeholders, sender and receiver.`

## Strategies
`Our strategy through the implementation was to create everything from scratch and to make everything dynamic and we implemented everything in an incremental way, small continues improvements to the existing code.
Because the appereance is the king we focused a good amount of our time, if not to make the page to look better, to at least look more completed and we manages to delivered a page with a dynamic menu and footer and a relatively advanced and most imporantly robust functionality that gives a possitive exprerience to our users. `


# About us
`We are students of Kristianstad University of Sweden and while we were working on this page we were in our third year and near graduation. Our plans for the future is to focus and to work with back-end and server technology as we define ourselves as backend programmers.`
